# Hydra configuration files

This directory contains `yaml` files used to parameterize `syngfn-mfa` trainings using Hydra.

The main.yaml file provides a set of basic adjustable parameters. For different modules, such as `dataset` and `policy`, users can further include other configurable parameters in `mf_buildingblock.yaml` for unified adjustments.
